# Early Projects
 Some of my earliest projects that survived a hard-drive failure.

🆚 CLI Battle Royale
* A text-based battle royale game that runs in the terminal. Allows the user/player to create characters who will automatically battle each other to be the last man standing.
* Developed in Python.

🧙🏻‍♂️ CLI Fantastic Roles
* A "Dungeon Master" program intended to be used in the form of a "competitive table-top RPG" style game. The players are given printed character sheets and the (extremely basic) map, and then use the program to create their characters and navigate around the world. The players can use certain commands on their turn to perform actions, and the program will give them the results of those actions. The goal is to earn enough money to buy the mansion - thereby winning the game - before the other players and without being defeated by the monsters that the program controls.
* Developed in Python.
